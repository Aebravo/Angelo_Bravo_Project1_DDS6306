Project 1 DDS6306

Dear Budweiser Team, 

The purpose of this analytics study is to determine the relationship of ABV and IBU between your different types of beers (primarily IPAs and Ales). In this study I will explain how ABV and IBU are distributed between your IPAs and Ales, prove to you that IPAs and Ales have significantly different ABV and IBU ratings, as well as recommend to you an ABV range for future IPAs and Ales you produce which your customers should be satisfied with.
